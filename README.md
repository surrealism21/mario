Obama is a Mario engine created by one guy. Obama is the working title for this Mario engine. There is little to no real code quality control here, pull requests and issues are apprecitated!

Planned features:

-Custom level support

-Custom tileset support

-Easy modding


Note for modders: this game will use a prototyping like system? I don't know how to describe how objects are generated here but I bet it's somewhat common in Lua programs?
