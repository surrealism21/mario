-- Texture atlases in the game, a System of great epics

-- TODO: functions to get the image data ðŸ˜­ I need to sleep so for now i'll just do pallets

-- guide to P numbers.
-- A p is a palette. It has tiles
-- Palette 0: dirt, blocks, bricks, bill blasters, pulleys, "Shroom Stem"
-- Palette 1: decals and pipes
-- Palette 2: Water, clouds, cloud block, Bowser bridge block
-- Palette 3: ? block, coins, bridge axe
-- However, there exists a PALETTE SHROOM. This palette is totally epic and used by the mushrooms, even though it's *technically* in palette 0.
-- The original game has weird shit for that mushroom thing.
